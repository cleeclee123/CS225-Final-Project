## How to Build (with execution examples)
<details>
 <summary> <strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

To build the file, use the command:
```bash
make
```

There are 4 main commands that can be run after building the main executable from the main command:
```bash
./main
```

</details>

## Testing
<details>
 <summary> <strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

The code provides a wide variety of tests for the various functions within the program. To run them and see the resulting account of success and failure use the command:
```bash
make test
```
to build them, and then run the test executible using:
```bash
./test
```
The tests that will be run are located within the tests folder of the project, along with many of the sample graphs that are useable as `./main` args.
