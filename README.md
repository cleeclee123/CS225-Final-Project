# Team Contract

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings**
We will have, at a minimum, weekly team stand-ups. Team members should block out around one hours for weekly stand-ups. We will use multiple platforms for team meetings, including but not limited to Zoom, Discord, and in-person meetings. If necessary, we will assign a note taker for out meeting. Such cases may be our initial design meeting and contact planning (FP1)

2. **Assistance**
Teammates will have access to each other through online communication platforms including but not limited to Zoom, Discord, Slack, Social Media applications, and text messages/phone calls. Teammates can also reach out to set up a in-person meeting. Teammates should expect a response back within EOD. 

3. **Respect**
We, as a group, will respect and practice fairness in a collaborative environment. Furthermore, we will encourage each other to share thoughts, ideas, and opinions of design and implementation of our project. We will ensure that each team member has the chance to share in meetings by following industry practices during stand-ups. I.E: taking turns and not interrupting during updates.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**
We will be following the Agile Methodology. This sprint-based project management system will allow team members to develop the project in small increments in a given timeline. This will, overall, result in ore effective collaborations amongst our team. We will assign task in a holistic and fair manner. For example, if a team member has multiple midterms to study for in a given week, the team member will be assign a lighter task or their timeline extend for that sprint. Furthermore, assignment will be based on the interests and strengths of each team member. Unexpected complications or unforeseen work will be handles by the team on a case-by-case basis.

5. **Time Commitment**
Agile Methodology does not place fix time commitment on team members. We will be running this project in a result-oriented way. In other word, if team members finish tasks on time (within the sprint timeline), there need not be a conversation of their time commitment. However, team members should estimate a similar ammount of time spent on completing machine problems earlier in the semester. We will address new conflicts or inevitably commitments as a team on a case-by-case basis.

6. **Conflict Resolution**
The team will resolve situations where there is a disagreement by setting up additional meetings and approach the diagreement in a pragmatic way. Situations where one or more members have not accomplished their tasks will be consider unacceptable. If these situations continue, further action may be taken place (escalating to mentor/course staff). Situations where one or more members are habitually late to meetings should address by reorganizing meeting structure (location, time, etc). The team is encouraged to resolve the issue as a team in a respectful manner before escalation to course staff.
